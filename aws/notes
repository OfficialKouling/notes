Amazon EC2 -- Instances, virtual "pc"
Elastic Load Balancing -- Balance between ex. sites(if you have 2 sites and 1mln requst, 500 000 > 1 site)
AWS Elastic Beanstalk -- Automatic up instance/site from zip archive
Amazon CloudFront -- Service to make hash your websites(usually used for static content)
Amazon CloudWatch -- Monitoring all your infrastructure
Amazon S3(simple storage service) -- Something like dropbox
	Amazon Glacier -- very cheap price, but it's not so fast, for download files you need to wait 3-5hours
Amazon EF5 -- Share disks to servers EC2
AWS CloudFormation -- infrastructure like code, automatic lifting infrastructure
AWS OpsWorks -- load recipe from chef
Amazon RDS -- database sql(posgres sql, aurora, mysql..)
Amazon DynamoDB -- database nosql
Amazon Redshift -- system of analyzing data(information)
Amazon EMR -- Work with Big Data
IAM -- users/groups/permissons.. smt like active directory
Amazon VPC(virtual prime network) -- virtual networks
Amazon Route 53 -- DNS server of amazon
Amazon SES -- server of emails
Amazon SNS -- notifications (email, messages, sms..) work with CloudWatch
Amazon SQS -- send, store and receive messages betweeb software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring

AMI(amazon machine images) -- smt like clonezilla, used for creating images of already installed instances
	ami built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions). faster boot.
	You can launch EC2 instances from: A public AMI; Your own AMI; An AWS Marketplace AMI
EBS snapshots -- copy of volumes(disks), they can go to the recycle bin(which store's copy's of disk from accenditealy removing vol.)
EBS -- smt like network pendrive's :D
EC2 Instance Store -- High-perfomance hardware disk, Better I/O perfomance, Good buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content, risk of data loss if hardware fails
EBS Volume types (6 types):
	gp2/gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume, balanced price and perfomance for a wide variety of workloads
	io1/io2 (SSD): Highest-perfomance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
	st1 	(HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
	sc1	(HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
		ONLY gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be user as boot volumes!!
	gp3:
		Baseline of 3000 IOPS and throughput of 125MiB/s
		Can increase IOPS up to 16000 and throughput up to 1000 MiB/s independently
	gp2:
		Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3000
		Size of volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16000
		3 IOPS per GB, means at 5334 GB we are at the max IOPS

	IOPS(PIOPS) SSD:
		application need more than 16000 IOPS or for critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance, great for databases workloads(sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
	io1/io2 (4GiB-16TiB):
		Max PIOPS: 64000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32000 for other
		Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
		io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GiB (at the same price as io1)
	io2 Block Express (4GiB-64TiB):
		Sub-millisecond latency
		Max PIOPS: 256000 with an IOPS:GiB ratio of 1000:1
	Supports EBS Multi-attach

	Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
		Cannot be a boot volume
		125 GiB to 16 TiB
		Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
			Big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing
			Max throughput 500 MiB/s - max IOPS 500
		Cold HDD (sc1):
			For data that is infrequently accessed
			Scenarios where lowest cost is important
			Max throughput 250MiB/s - max IOPS 250
